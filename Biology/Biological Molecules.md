## Need for Food
> what are [[Biological Molecules]] used for? 

- As a source of energy for activities of the body
	- Food stores chemical energy which is released when it is broken down during cellular respiration
- For growth
	- Food provides substances needed for making new cells and tissues
- For replacement of worn-out and damaged tissues
- For replacement of minerals lost
- For maintenance of health

## Balanced Diet
> Failure to maintain a balance diet results in malnutrition
