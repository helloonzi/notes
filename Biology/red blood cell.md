> A differentiated cell which is specialised to transport oxygen

# Functions & Structures
- Contains [[haemoglobin]] 
- Has no [[nucleus]] 
	- Allows the [[red blood cell]] to carry more haemoglobin and thus more oxygen
- Has a biconcave shape
	- Increases surface area to volume ratio for faster rate of diffusion of oxygen 
- Elastic
	- Can turn bell shaped in order to squeeze through blood vessels smaller than itself in diameter
