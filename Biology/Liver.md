# Functions of the Liver
## Regulation of blood glucose concentration
> The normal blood sugar level is 70 - 90 mg of glucose / 100ml of blood

- A rise in blood glucose concentration above normal stimulates the pancreas to secrete more insulin into the bloodstream
- Insulin is transported to the liver via blood vessels
- As blood passes through the liver, the insulin stimulation the liver to convert excess glucose into glycogen which is stored
> vice versa when blood glucose conc. decreases below normal

- Storage and conversion of glycogen are controlled by insulin, adrenaline and glucagon

## Production of bile
> bile is produced by the liver, stored in the gallbladder

## Iron Storage
- Red blood cells are destroyed in the spleen
- Haemoglobin is brought to the liver
- Liver breaks down haemoglobin and stores the iron released in the process
- Bile pigments are also formed from the breakdown of haemoglobin

## Protein synthesis 
Liver synthesises proteins found in the blood plasma
- E.g. albumins, globulins, fibrinogen

## Deamination of amino acids
![[deamination]]

## Breakdown of Hromones
> hormones are broken down in the liver after they have served their purpose

## Detoxification
> Converts harmful substances into harmless ones

- Drugs and alcohol are also broken down in the liver
	- Liver has the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase which breaks down alcohol to acetaldehyde
		- Which is in turn broken down to compounds that can be used in respiration
