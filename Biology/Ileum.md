> a part of the small intestine, contains many adaptations for absorption of digested food

## Adaptations
1. Surface area of small intestine is increased via
	- Inner walls are thrown into numerous transverse folds and furrows
	- Inner walls are lined with numerous minute finger like projection called villi
	- Epithelial cells of the villi bear numerous microvilli to increase surface area more
		- All these increases surface area to volume ratio -> increases rate of diffusion
2. Epithelium is only one cell thick
	- Reduces the diffusion distance, increasing rate of diffusion
3. Each villus has many blood capillaries and a lacteal
	- Allow blood to quickly transport away absorbed nutrients
	- Maintain steep diffusion gradient to increase rate of diffusion
4. Epithelial cells have many mitochondria
	- Provide energy for active transport of nutrients into the villi

## Absorption of Digested Food
> By the processes of diffusion and active transport

### Fats
- Fatty acids react with bile salts to form soluble soaps which diffuses into the epithelium
- In the epithelium, the soaps and glycerol recombine to form minute fat globules which are absorbed by lacteals
	- Lacteals form part of the lymphatic system which eventually empty contents into bloodstream
