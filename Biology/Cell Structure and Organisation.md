# Cell Theory
> Proposed by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann in 1828 and Rudolf Virchow added the final tenet in 1858

The [[cell]] theory states that: 
1. All life forms are made from one or more cells
2. Cells only arise from pre-existing cells
3. The cell is the smallest form of life

## Prokaryotic Cells
> Genetic material is NOT enclosed by nuclear membrane and lies free in the cytoplasm

______
> [!fun fact]
> Pro -> before
> Karyon -> nucleus 

## Eukaryotic Cells
> Contains a distinct nucleus surrounded by a nuclear membrane 

(usually found in multicellular organisms)

> [!fun fact]
> eu -> true (has a 'true' nucleus)

# Microscopes
> Cells are too small to be seen by the naked eye, therefore, light and electron microscopes are used to see cells and their parts

## Light VS Electron Microscopes
> Both can be used to take a [[micrograph]]

## Viewing cells 
### Longitudinal Section
> cutting along the y-axis of the cell (the long way)

### Transverse section
> cutting at right angles to the longitudinal plane (across the cell)

# What makes up the Cell? 
## Composition of a Plant Cell

______
### Parts of the Plant Cell: 
- [[nucleus]]
- [[cytoplasm]]
- [[cellulose cell wall]]
- large central [[vacuole]]
- [[chloroplast]]
- [[mitochondria]]
- [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]]
- [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]]
- [[ribosome]]
- [[golgi apparatus]]

## Composition of an Animal Cell

_____
### Parts of the Animal Cell
-  [[nucleus]]
- [[cytoplasm]]
- small, circular and temporary [[vacuole]]
- [[mitochondria]]
- [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]]
- [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]]
- [[ribosome]]
- [[golgi apparatus]]

## Advantages of Multiple Membranes
> Membranes allow compartmentalisation and specialisation to organelles. Chemical reactions, fluids & products can be contained & separated from cytoplasm

# Cell Differentiation 
> A process by which a cell becomes specialised for a specific function

## Advantages? 
- Ensures all functions are performed faster, better and more efficiently as cells carry out their specified functions only
- Allows for division of labour

## Disadvantages? 
- Differentiated cells cannot revert back to original state
- Unable to adapt to a sudden change
	- Can only do what they are specialised in

# Specialised Cells (need rmb)
## Red Blood Cells 
> Transports oxygen from lungs to all parts of the body

- Contains [[haemoglobin]] 
- Has no [[nucleus]] 
	- Allows the [[red blood cell]] to carry more haemoglobin and thus more oxygen
- Has a biconcave shape
	- Increases surface area to volume ratio for faster rate of diffusion of oxygen 
- Elastic
	- Can turn bell shaped in order to squeeze through blood vessels smaller than itself in diameter

![[Screenshot 2024-06-12 at 3.11.24 PM.png]]
_____
## Root Hair Cell 
> Absorb water and dissolved mineral salts in plants

- Long and narrow root hair
	- Increases surface area to volume ratio for root cell to absorb water and mineral salt at faster rate
- Presences of many [[mitochondria]] 
	- Releases more energy for [[active transport]] to take place
 ![[Screenshot 2024-06-12 at 3.13.15 PM.png]]
 _____
 ## Muscle Cell 
 > For the movement of animals
 
 - Contains many [[mitochondria]]
	- Provides energy for contraction of muscle cell
- Has contractile protein fibres
	- Can contract and relax to bring about movement
- Contains many nuclei
	- Allows for cell division
