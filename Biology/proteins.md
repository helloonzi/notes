# How are proteins formed
----
![[amino acids]]

Proteins are formed through the process of condensation of amino acids and the bond is called peptide bond

- Many amino acids joined together form a polypeptide
- One or more polypeptide chains folded together form a protein 

# Characteristics of proteins
- Proteins have complex, 3D shape
- The coils are held in place by weak bonds
	- They are easily broken down by heat and chemicals
- When the 3D structure is lost, the protein is said to be denatured
	- They cannot regain their shape and will lose their functionality

# Functions of proteins
- Synthesis of new protoplasm, growth and repair of worn-out body cells
- Synthesis of enzymes and some hormones
- Formation of antibodies to combat diseases
- Source of energy

# Biuret test
> [[Biuret test]] is the test for the presence of proteins
