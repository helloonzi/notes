> Dilute solution of mucus, hydrochloric acid, pepsin and rennin

- Mucus 
	- Protects stomach wall from being digested by enzymes produced
	- Moistens food to allow easy movement in the stomach
- Dilute hydrochloric acid
	- Kills harmful microorganisms in food
	- Provides optimum pH (2) for enzyme pepsin to digest proteins
	- Stops action of salivary amylase by denaturing it
- Pepsin and Rennin
	- Acts on proteins
	- Pepsin digests proteins to polypeptides
	- Rennin curdles milk protein by converting soluble protein caseinogens into insoluble casein
		- Insoluble casein remains long enough in the stomach to be digested
	- Optimum pH 2
