> Biological [[catalyst]] made up of protein, it alters the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction. They are destroyed high temperature

# 2 types of Enzyme-catalysed reaction
1. [[anabolism]]
2. [[catabolism]]

# Functions of Enzymes
1. Speed up rate of reaction
	- Lowers activation energy
2. Control over [[metabolism]] of body/cells
	- Large numbers of reaction operates in our body simultaneously
	- Crucial to keep the reactions separate and independent, yet to also synchronise them
		- The specificity of enzymes allows our body to do that

# Characteristic of enzymes
1. Mostly proteins
	- Others are RNA
2. They are potent, they are required in minute amounts
3. Highly specific in their action
4. Affected by temperature
5. Affected by pH 

# Speeding up rate of rxn
> Enzymes lower the [[activation energy]] required

- An enzyme has a specific 3D shape. 
	- It has a part called the **active site**
- Only substrates with a complementary 3D shape to the active site can fit into the enzyme
	- This results in the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex
- While the substrate is attached to the active site, chemical reaction occurs
	- The substrate is converted to the products
- The products then leave the active site
	- The enzyme molecules remain unchanged and are free to combine again

## Why Enzymes are potent
> They are not chemically changed at the end of the reaction, hence are only needed in very small amounts

## Why are enzymes so specific? 
> They are proteins which have different shapes and surface configurations, they need a substrate with a complementary shape

# Effect of Temperature
> Enzymes are denatured at high temperatures

1. At low temperatures, there is little activity as enzymes are inactive
2. As temperature increases, enzyme activity increases
	- As temperature rises, molecules gain kinetic energy and move faster
	- Substrates and enzymes molecules collide with each other more often, increasing the frequency of effective collisions 
		- Increases the rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complex
			- Increases rate of formation of product
3. At optimum temperature, there is highest enzyme activity
4. Beyond the optimum temperature, enzyme activity decreases as enzymes are denatured
	- Enzymes are protein molecules made up of chains of [[amino acids]] folded into 3D shapes held by hydrogen bonds
	- At high temperature, hydrogen bonds in enzymes are broken
		- The enzymes loses it's shape and active site
		- Enzymes are denatured
		- Denaturation is irreversible

# Limiting Factors
> a [[limiting factor]] is a factor that directly affects the rate at which a process or chemical reaction occurs if its quantity is changed
