> Movement of water molecules from a solution of higher [[water potential]] to a solution of lower [[water potential]], through a partially permeable membrane

- A special form of diffusion
	- Characteristics of movement and factors affecting movement are similar to diffusion
- However, osmosis is specifically refering to the movement of *water molecules* across a *[[partially permeable membrane]]*

# Partially Permeable Membrane
> Allows some substances to pass through it but not others

# Water potential
> Measure of tendency of water to enter or leave a solution to anther solution; always discussed in comparison between 2 solutions

- A water potential gradient is established when a [[partially permeable membrane]] separates 2 solution of different [[water potential]]

- B more concentrated than A
- B has lower water potential than A
	- Water molecules move from dilute solution A of higher [[water potential]] to concentrated solution B of lower [[water potential]] through the [[partially permeable membrane]] via [[Osmosis (Passive Transport]]

_____
# Factors affecting rate of osmosis
- Particle size
    - Smaller = Faster
- Concentration gradient
    - Steeper = Faster
- Diffusion pathway/thickness of membrane
    - Shorter/Thinner = Faster
- Surface area to Volume ratio
    - Larger = Faster
- Surface area
    - Larger = Faster
