# Diffusion
![[Diffusion (Passive Transport)]]

> [!tip]
> Cells are usually smaller so that it's surface area to volume ratio remains high, making it more effective for diffusion and osmosis!

## Terms Related to Osmosis

![[hypertonic]]
![[hypotonic]]
![[isotonic]]
___
## Osmosis in Plant Cells
### In a hypotonic solution
1. Cell sap has lower water potential than surrounding solution
2. By osmosis, water molecules moves across the partially permeable cell membrane into the cell
3. Vacuole increases in size, cell expands, cytoplasm exerts a pressure against the cell wall and cell becomes turgid 
4. Cell wall prevents cell from bursting
### In a hypertonic solution
1. Cell sap has higher water potential than surrounding solution
2. By osmosis, water molecules move across the partially permeable cell membrane out of the cell
3. Vacuole and cell decreases in size, cell becomes flaccid
4. Cytoplasm and cell membrane shrinks away from cell wall and cell becomes plasmolysed

## Osmosis in Animal Cells 
### In a hypotonic solution
- Cytoplasm has lower water potential than surrounding solution
- By osmosis, water molecules moves across the partially permeable cell membrane into the cell
- Cell volume increases 
- Cell membrane is too delicate to prevent further expansion, cell bursts
### In a hypertonic solution
- Cytoplasm has higher water potential than surrounding solution
- By osmosis, water molecules move across the partially permeable cell membrane out of the cell
- Cell volume decreases
- Cell membrane crinkles and forms spikes in a process called crenation
