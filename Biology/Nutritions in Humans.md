# Nutrition
> what is nutrition? 

- Process by which organisms obtain food and energy for growth, repair and maintenance of the body
- Nutrition consists of the following processes
	- Feeding/Ingestion
	- Digestion
		- Large food molecules are broken down into smaller, soluble molecules that can be absorbed into body cells
	- Absorption
		- Nutrients move from small intestine into bloodstream
	- Assimilation
		- Nutrients are used by cells to provide energy or to make new cytoplasm for growth
	- Egestion 
		- Undigested matter is removed from the body

# Human Digestive System
> The alimentary canal and the organs associated with it

## General Structure
> the wall of the alimentary canal consists of 4 layers

![[Screenshot 2024-07-05 at 9.07.49 PM.png]]

- Serous membrane
	- Outermost layer; moist and slippery so that friction is reduced when organs slide past one another
- Muscle layer
	- 2 layers of smooth muscles:
	- Outer longitudinal 
	- Inner circular muscles
	- Contractions are slow and sustained
- Submucous coat
	- Mainly blood vessels and connective tissues
- Mucous layer
	- Much folded layer
	- Contains gland cells, some of which secrete mucus

## Mouth
> Food enters the body through the mouth

![[Screenshot 2024-07-05 at 9.20.10 PM.png]]
- Saliva 
	- Moistens mouth, tongue and lips which facilitates talking
	- contains: 
		- Water and mucin which softens food
		- Salivary amylase which digest starch to maltose, it's optimum pH is 7
		- Enzyme lysozyme to remove bacteria found between teeth, thus preventing tooth decay

## Pharynx
> Leads from mouth to the oesophagus; common passage for food and air

![[Screenshot 2024-07-05 at 9.25.15 PM.png]]
- Tongue presses upwards and back against roof of mouth
- Soft palate closes nasal cavity at the back 
- Larynx moves upwards so that glottis is covered by epiglottis 
	- Food cannot enter the trachea

However, 
- it may fail and the person may choke 

> [!fact]
> Swallowing action is voluntary initially, once food reaches back of mouth, swallowing is automatic

## Oesophagus
> Connects the pharnyx to the stomach

- Consists of a layer of longitudinal muscles and a layer of circular muscles
- [[peristalsis]] in the walls of the oesophagus pushes food down into the stomach

## Stomach
> Distensible, muscular bag with thick and well developed muscular walls

- Lies beneath the diaphragm to the left side of the abdomen and is partly covered by the liver
- Has numerous pits and gastric glands 
	- In the stomach lining 
	- Gastric glands secrete [[gastric juice]]
		- Plays important part in digestion
- [[peristalsis]] in stomach wall
	- Churns and breaks up food
	- Mixes food well with [[gastric juice]]
	- ![[gastric juice]]
- Food stays in the stomach for 3 to 4 hours
- Partly digested food becomes liquefied, forming chyme

### Peptic Ulcers
> Open sores that develop on the inside lining of the stomach and upper portion of the small intestine

- Gastric ulcers
- Duodenal ulcers

## Small Intestine
> Consists of the U-shaped duodenum, jejunum and much coiled ileum. Around 6m long, carries out most of the digestive process as the lining of the walls contains glands that secret digestive enzymes

Contains intestinal glands which produce intestinal juice which contains enzymes
- Maltase 
	- Breaks down maltose to glucose
- Lactase
	- Breaks down lactose to glucose and galactose
- Protease
	- Breaks down polypeptides to amino acids
- Lipase
	- Breaks down fats to fatty acids and glycerol
### Duodenum
- Receives [[pancreatic juice]] from pancreas via the pancreatic duct
- Receives bile form liver via the bile duct

### [[Ileum]]
- Where most of the absorption takes place
- Contains very highly coiled tube
- Inner walls are thrown into numerous transverse folds and furrows

## Pancreas
> Gland lying in the loop of the duodenum, produces [[pancreatic juice]]

![[pancreatic juice]]

## [[Liver]] and Gallbladder
> The liver is the largest gland in the body! 

- liver produces [[bile]] which is stored in the gallbladder
	- ![[bile]]

## Large Intestine
> 1.5 meters long and consists of the colon, rectum and anus, it is also much broader than the small intestine

### Colon
- Receives indigestible matter from the ileum
### Rectum
- Short muscular tube
- Temporary store for [[faeces]]
- Removal of [[faeces]] is known as defecation or egestion

# Transport and Utilisation of Absorbed Foods
> what happens to the food we digested and absorbed? 

## Sugars
- Carried from the ileum to the liver by the hepatic portal vein
- In the liver and muscles, excess glucose are converted to glycogen and stored
	- Regulated by hormone insulin (produced by pancreas)
	- Glycogen in muscle cells are not returned into circulation
		- It is used by muscle cells only
- Some glucose is transported by the blood leaving the liver and is distributed around the body
- Used by all cells as a source of energy
- Excess glucose is returned to the liver and stored as glycogen
	- Short term store, sufficient for about 6 hours
	- Conversion of glycogen to glucose requires glucagon
- Excess glycogen is converted to fats for storage

## Amino Acids
- Passes through the liver before reaching the general circulation
- Converted into protoplasm used for growth and repair of worn out parts of the body
- Used for form enzymes and hormones
- Excess amino acids are not stored 
	- Returned to liver to be deaminated
		- ![[deamination]]
	- Urea is then transported to the kidneys and excreted in urine
	- Remaining part of amino acid is converted into glucose

## Fats
- Fluids in lacteals contain colourless liquid called lympth
- Lacteals join to form larger lymphatic vessels which discharge contents into thoracic duct and then bloodstream 
- Excess fats are stored in adipose tissue, beneath the skin, around the heart kidneys etc
- Due to the high energy it is an "effective" long term store

# Effects of Alcohol Consumption
> Legal age to buy/drink alcohol in Singapore is 18!!!

## Harmful Effects of Alcohol

Cirrhosis of liver
- Liver cells are destroyed and replaced with fibrous tissue
	- Reduces liver's ability to function
	- Leads to 
		- Haemorrhage (bleeding in liver)
		- Liver failure
		- Death
Risk of Gastric Ulcers
- Alcohol stimulates secretion of acid in stomach 
	- Excessive stomach acid increases risk of gastric ulcers
Malnutrition
Dilation of blood vessels of skin
- Heat loss
- Hypothermia
- Death
Depressant
- Alcohol slows down some brain functions
Reduced self control
- Person becomes carefree 
- They may do things that the regret
Increased Reaction Time
- People cannot move steadily
	- Slurred speech
	- Blurred vision
	- Poor muscular coordination
- Judgement deteriorates

## Long Term Effects
1. Wet Brain
	- Type of dementia caused by brain damage
	- Alcohol interferes with absorption of [[vitamin B1 (thiamine)]] in the small intestine
		- ![[vitamin B1 (thiamine)]]
2. Shrinkage of brain volume
	- Brain becomes smaller than normal
		- Especially region associated with memory and reasoning
	- Heavy consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can interfere with the development of the foetus' brain
		- Leads to lifelong, physical mental and behavioural problems
		- Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders

##  Social Implications
1. People can become addicted to alcohol and be unable to stop drinking
	- Bodies become dependent on alcohol
2. Alcoholics may
	- Neglect work and families
	- Exhibit violent behaviour
	- Be at higher risk of committing crimes
