______
## Monosaccharides 
> The basic unit of carbohydrates. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into cells

![[monosaccharides]]
## Tests for Reducing Sugars
> [[Benedict's test]] for [[reducing sugars]]. Reducing sugars are basically just monosaccharides + maltose.

## Disaccharides
> 2 [[monosaccharides]] joined together via the [[condensation reaction]]

![[disaccharide]]

> Many [[monosaccharides]] joined together to form large molecules

## Polysaccharides
> Many [[monosaccharides]] joined together

![[polysaccharide]]

## Test for Starch
![[iodine test]]

### Uses
- Starch and Glycogen are used as storage materials as
	- They are insoluble in water
		- They do not affect water potential in cells
	- They are large molecules
		- They do not diffuse through cell membrane
	- They are easily hydrolysed to glucose when needed
		- They are branched, allowing more "starting points" for enzymes to act on to break down 
		- Faster access to glucose when needed
	- Their molecules have compact shapes so they occupy less space
		- More food can be stored

# Hydrolysis 
> the breakdown of [[disaccharide]] sugars and [[polysaccharide]]s by heating with dilute acids or treating with suitable enzymes

# Functions of Carbohydrates 
> What are they used for? 

- Substrate for respiration
	- Energy reserves such as starch and glycogen
- Structural carbohydrates
	- Cellulose in plants
- Converted to other organic compounds
	- Fats or amino acids
- Formation of nucleic acids
- Synthesise lubricants
- Synthesise nectar in flowers to attract insects

>[!tip]
>Excess carbohydrates are converted to glycogen or fat in liver. Glycogen is stored in liver and muscles while fats are deposited in the abdomen, around kidneys and under the skin
