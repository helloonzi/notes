> Movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a lower concentration, down a concentration gradient until all particles are evenly distributed such that dynamic equilibrium is reached (no net movement)

- Passive as it does NOT require the expenditure of energy to transport substances

# Factors Affecting Diffusion
- Particle size
	- Smaller = Faster
- Concentration gradient
	- Steeper = Faster
- Diffusion pathway/thickness of membrane
	- Shorter/Thinner = Faster
- Surface area to Volume ratio
	- Larger = Faster
- Surface area
	- Larger = Faster
